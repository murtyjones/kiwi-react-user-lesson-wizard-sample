The `UserLessonWizard` component is the heart and soul of the Kiwi student experience. You can see it in action by signing up for an account and kiwicompute.com and entering lesson 1.

This wizard controls the interface for:
1. A student's navigation through a lesson
2. Displaying a slide content for each slide in a lesson
3. Grading a student's answers to quizes and code challenges
